## Operational Efficiency and Quality Control Report

üìå Project Overview
I am excited to share my latest analytics project focused on improving operational efficiency and quality control in a manufacturing environment.

This project was especially meaningful because it marked my second time working with Google Sheets, a tool I initially found intimidating, much like my first experience with DAX. But just as I did with DAX, I leaned in, embraced the challenge, and I am proud of the outcome. It's a solid step forward, and I am excited to continue growing from here.

### Key Insights
* Machine 005 had the highest downtime and defect count, suggesting potential maintenance issues.

* Machine 002 stood out as the most reliable, with low downtime and the highest efficiency score.

* The Morning shift led in production volume, while the Night shift was most efficient with the least downtime.

* The Afternoon shift recorded the lowest efficiency and highest downtime, pointing to an area for process improvement.

* Raw material and production batches were analyzed to trace root causes of product defects.

### Tools & Skills Used

* Google Sheets

### What I Learned
This project reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in operations, where efficiency isn‚Äôt just about speed, but also about quality, timing, and strategic resource use.
