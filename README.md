Operational Efficiency and Quality Control Report

Operational Efficiency & Quality Control Dashboard
Manufacturing Analytics with Power BI, SQL & Google Sheets

📌 Project Overview
I'm excited to share my latest analytics project focused on improving operational efficiency and quality control in a manufacturing environment.

This project was especially meaningful because it marked my second time working with Google Sheets — a tool I initially found intimidating, much like my first experience with DAX. But just as I did with DAX, I leaned in, embraced the challenge, and I’m proud of the outcome. It's a solid step forward, and I’m excited to continue growing from here.
